<a name ="database"><h2>Import / Export Database</h2></a></br> 
<p>
You should only use this feature if you are changing from the "Lite" version to the "Full" version or if you are changing devices you are using ther app on 
or you are using the app on multiple devices. Before you use this feature make sure all Good Bowler Stats apps are upgraded to the latest released version.
Internal changes made to the database in different can cause the app to crash if the versions are not the same. You must also have a sdcard installed or your
device has to have a spot for memory labeled "sdcard"(Most new phones have this, you will get an error if the file cannot write). 
<h3>Exporting the Database</h3>
<ol>
<li>Tap your "menu" button the title screen of Good Bowler Stats</li>
<li>Tap the "Export Database Button</li>
</ol>
Read the message and it should say "Database bowlerdata written to sdcard" or "Error database bowlerdata not written to sdcard". If you get the error check 
everything in the first paragraph of this section and try again. IF you get the successful message then you will have a file called "bowlerdata" in the
"/sdcard/" of your file system(This should be the first folder that comes up when you open a file explorer). You can now move this transfer this file to 
another device or just save as a backup to another folder.(If you have a sqlite browser you can browse the tables and view the data).
<h3>Importing a Database</h3>
Before you attempt to import a database make sure the "bowlerdata" file is in the sdcard directory(or whatever directory your phone uses for external 
non-system storage). Importing a database will wipe out the existing database so if you are not sure you might want to export the existing database first
and save the "bowlerdata" file the export creates to a new folder or change the name. The import function looks for a file called "bowlerdata" so it must be
there in order to import. Just simply access the menu from the title screen of the Good Bowler Stats app and click Import Database. A success or error message will 
be displayed. If succesful the screen should refresh with the new data.</br>
